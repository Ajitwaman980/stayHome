why used this ?   req.session.redirectUrl = req.originalUrl;
 session stored the information 

bez we need to make sure that user redirect originalUrl path  ex. when the user 
go to add new listing but user can not login then firstly we need to login the user and 
then its going to actul path so we need to save the user redirectUrl path
